    "Pandas provides a wide range of functions to manipulate and transform data in a DataFrame. Here are some common functions for data manipulation in Pandas:\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Selection and Filtering:\n",
    "\n",
    "loc[] and iloc[]: These functions are used to select specific rows and columns based on labels (loc[]) or integer-based indexing (iloc[]).\n",
    "[] operator: It allows you to select specific columns or filter rows based on conditions using boolean indexing.\n",
    "Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:\n",
    "\n",
    "drop(): It allows you to remove rows or columns from the DataFrame.\n",
    "fillna(): This function is used to fill missing or null values with specified values or strategies.\n",
    "replace(): It replaces specific values in the DataFrame with other values.\n",
    "astype(): This function is used to convert the data type of one or more columns.\n",
    "Data Transformation and Aggregation:\n",
    "\n",
    "apply(): It applies a function to each element, row, or column of the DataFrame.\n",
    "map(): This function is used to map values from one set to another based on a defined mapping.\n",
    "groupby(): It allows you to group the DataFrame based on one or more columns and perform aggregations.\n",
    "pivot_table(): This function creates a pivot table from the DataFrame, summarizing data based on specified rows and columns.\n",
    "Sorting and Ranking:\n",
    "\n",
    "sort_values(): It sorts the DataFrame based on one or more columns.\n",
    "rank(): This function assigns ranks to data elements based on specified criteria.\n",
    "sort_index(): It sorts the DataFrame based on the index.\n",
    "Data Merging and Joining:\n",
    "\n",
    "merge(): It combines multiple DataFrames based on common columns or indexes.\n",
    "concat(): This function concatenates DataFrames vertically or horizontally.\n",
    "join(): It joins DataFrames based on index or key columns.\n",
    "Data Aggregation and Summarization:\n",
    "\n",
    "sum(), mean(), median(), max(), min(): These functions compute summary statistics for numeric columns.\n",
    "count(): It counts the number of non-null values in each column.\n",
    "value_counts(): This function counts the frequency of unique values in a column.\n",
    "These are just a few examples of the many functions available in Pandas for data manipulation. The choice of function depends on the specific task or transformation you need to perform on your DataFrame. The Pandas documentation provides comprehensive details on these functions and many others for various data manipulation operations.\n",

    "Series: A Series is a one-dimensional labeled array that holds data of any type. It is similar to a column in a spreadsheet or a single attribute/column in a database table. Once a Series is created, its elements cannot be modified individually. However, you can create a new Series with modified values based on the original Series.\n",
    "\n",
    "DataFrame: A DataFrame is a two-dimensional labeled data structure with columns of potentially different types. It can be thought of as a collection of Series, where each Series represents a column. DataFrames are mutable, meaning you can modify individual values, add or remove columns, and perform various transformations on the DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "Panel: A Panel is a three-dimensional data structure that extends the concept of a DataFrame. It is less commonly used compared to Series and DataFrame. However, it is worth noting that Panels are considered deprecated in the latest versions of Pandas (version 1.0 and higher). Instead, multi-indexing is recommended for handling higher-dimensional data.\n",
